"""
Proves the code AT AN ADDRESS is the same program as a local artifact.

    python3 tools/verify_onchain.py <address> build/PredictStake.min.py

`genlayer code` does not print the contract source alone: it prints a blank
line, a `Result:` header, the source, and trailing blanks. Diffing against that
raw output reports a mismatch for a contract that is in fact identical — which
is worse than no check, because it teaches you to ignore the check. This strips
the chrome and compares sha256.

Three outcomes, because there are three real cases:

  MATCH       byte-for-byte identical.
  EQUIVALENT  the same program under a consistent renaming of PRIVATE
              identifiers. The mangler picks those names by frequency rank, so
              an artifact rebuilt after any edit to the source can rename every
              private symbol while the program - and the public ABI - is
              unchanged. Reporting that as a difference teaches you to ignore
              the check; reporting it as a match would hide a real edit. So it
              is its own answer, and it is only reached when the token streams
              agree position for position AND the renaming is a bijection.
  DIFFER      anything else.

Exit 0 on MATCH or EQUIVALENT, 1 on a difference.
